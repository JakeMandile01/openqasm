**Jake to do**: add link to electoral roll once finalised.

The election will take place online using the [Belenios online voting platform](https://www.belenios.org/).
Three people will be elected, to join Steven Heidel (Amazon), Bettina Heim (Nvidia) and Philipp Schindler (University of Innsbruck) whose seats are not up for re-election this cycle.
Votes will be counted using the [Condorcet/Schulze method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) to produce a ranked list of the candidates.
The top three candidates will be elected to the TSC.
The election will close on Friday the 6th of January, 2023 at 12:00 UTC.

In alphabetical order, the candidates are:

## Blake Johnson (IBM)

Blake is the Quantum Engine Lead at IBM Quantum, where one of his principal responsibilities is
technical evolution of what is executable on IBM Quantum systems. Blake has sought to ensure that
OpenQASM lives up to its name of being an open project, by soliciting feedback on early drafts of
the OpenQASM 3 proposal, and eventually forming the OpenQASM Technical Steering committee. If
elected for another term, Blake will strive to continue to expand the OpenQASM community and create
an ecosystem of people and code that work together across a variety of contexts (e.g. academic and
industry, qubit modality, etc.) while also pushing for a language that can exercise increasingly
powerful capabilities in quantum computing systems.
